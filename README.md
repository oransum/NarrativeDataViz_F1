## Narrative Visualizations - Formula One Racing
This is a story-telling visualisation about *Formula One Racing*. It gives a brief intro but quick dive-in about F1 Legends, drivers' contribution and team performance in modern era.

## Technology
It is implemented in *D3.js* and of type **Martini Glass narrative**. The full story is split into two parts, you may go to my medium blog for the experience.

It's very easy to make some words **bold** and other words *italic* with Markdown. You can even [link to Google!](http://google.com)
